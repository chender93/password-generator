Password Generator
Objective
I was tasked with creating an application for a webpage where the user could create a secure password. I was provided with the index, CSS, and js file, but needed to include the JavaScript codes to ensure the webpage would display a random code.

Approach
I started with pseudocoding in the JS file. I wanted to make sure I had a clear mental picture of what I wanted to do. After pseudocoding, I started creating variables and prompts that would walk the end-user through the process of creating a password. They were given 4 criteria they could include in their generated password. They were required to choose at least one.

Lower case letters
Upper case letters
Numbers
and
Special Characters
I initially wanted to pull items from each array chosen to generate the password. I had trouble defining the length of my password once I concatenated the arrays. I spoke with a few of my colleagues and decided it would be easier to create strings for the criteria and pull individuals characters from there. I tested my site to ensure the user could not create a password longer or shorter than the requirements. I also ensured that the user chose at least one criterion before finishing my code.
Final Statements/ Conclusion
I learned from this week's challenge that there are hundreds of ways to cook an egg. Although I struggled to get my code to work the way I intended, I learned new ways to complete the same objective and how to explain what issue I am facing specifically. I am getting much better with Google-fu and reaching out to fellow colleagues if I'm getting stuck. I look forward to learning more and seeing what is ahead.
